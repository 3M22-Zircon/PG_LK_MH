# PG_LK_MH 

## A Python script that generates strong and secure passwords based on user preferences. The script will allow users to specify the length of the password, as well as whether to include uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

Key Features:
User Input: Prompt users to specify the length of the password and their preferences for including uppercase letters, lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters.

Password Generation: Generate a random password based on user preferences, ensuring that it meets the specified length and includes the selected character types.
  
Strength and Security: Ensure that the generated passwords are strong and secure by using a combination of different character types and avoiding common patterns or easily guessable sequences.
   
Error Handling: Implement error handling to validate user input and provide appropriate feedback in case of invalid input or errors.
    
User-Friendly Interface: Design the script with a user-friendly interface that guides users through the password generation process and displays the generated password clearly.
    
Cross-Platform Compatibility: Ensure that the script is compatible with different operating systems (Windows, macOS, Linux) and can be easily run from the command line.
